# 🍄 Task Tide #
As an engineering student, I am constantly working on ways to improve my technical skills. The inspiration behind this project was to make a task list for every current project I am working on (While learning React and Javascript). 

Task Tide is a web application made by React and Javascript to store a users technical projects in a kanban board style. 

# 🍀 Features #
- Input ticket while selecting tags for what technical skill the project is achieving.
- Placing tickets in three categories; In development, In Progress, Complete.
- Tickets can be deleted.

# 🐙 Next Steps #
This project is currently *in development*. I am working on finishing the code for the components and starting the functionality for adding in tasks. 
- My goal after is to implement sound when a button is presed.

Here is my figma for how my web application will look at the end!
